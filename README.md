# Brain-Tumor-Distribution-Patient-Risk-Analytics
Project Overview
This project analyzes clinical and demographic data to understand the distribution of brain tumor cases, affected regions, tumor types, and diagnosis patterns over time.
The dashboard supports healthcare professionals and researchers in identifying high-risk populations and planning medical response strategies.
 Business Problem
Medical institutions need visibility into:
which age groups are most affected
tumor type prevalence
frequently impacted brain regions
changes in diagnoses across years
patient characteristics for resource planning
Without analytics, these insights remain buried in records.
 Dashboard Features
KPIs
Total Patients: 84
Average Age: 41.21
Average Tumor Size: 5.97
Visual Analysis
✔ Tumor type distribution
✔ Most affected brain regions
✔ Annual diagnosis trend
✔ Top impacted age groups
✔ Patient segmentation by tumor grade
✔ Confirmed vs unconfirmed cases
 Key Insights
Examples of what the dashboard highlights:
The 31–40 age group shows the highest occurrence.
Certain tumor types dominate overall diagnosis.
Cerebellum and brainstem appear frequently affected.
Diagnosis rates vary significantly year by year.
